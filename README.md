# cbmLAD: Logical Analysis of Data for Condition-Based Maintenance

cbmLAD is a software tool implementing the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD) methodology, designed specifically for condition-based maintenance applications.

This tool combines logic, combinatorics, and optimization to detect patterns in binary datasets and support decision-making in predictive maintenance scenarios.

Key components of cbmLAD:

Boolean Logic: Feature binarization and threshold generation for converting continuous variables into binary form.

Combinatorics: Pattern selection based on characteristic combinations of binary features.

Optimization: Pattern optimization using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithms to improve solution quality.

cbmLAD is primarily used in industrial maintenance contexts, offering interpretable models and efficient pattern discovery.
